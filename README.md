# New Hope International Android App README #

This README documents the steps  necessary to get the application up and running

### How do I get set up? ###

Finding the tools necessary for Android development is rather simple. Whether you have a Linux, Mac, or Windows machine, you can develop for Android by downloading Android Studio at http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html

Android Studio is the official Android SDK. Please do not use Eclipse to build this project.

### Contribution guidelines ###

Please only commit code that compiles and does not crash. Understandably some code may lead to unforeseen crashes, but by compiling and testing on the emulator you should be able to catch it before committing. 

### Who do I talk to? ###
For any questions please contact Mark Merin
